## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

The following machine learning models were trained to predict creditworthiness:

| Model                 | Accuracy  | Precision | Recall   | F1-Score | ROC-AUC  |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 0.861     | 0.764     | 0.531    | 0.627    | 0.869    |
| Decision Tree        | 0.893     | 0.740     | 0.793    | 0.765    | 0.857    |
| Random Forest        | 0.932     | 0.950     | 0.731    | 0.826    | 0.938    |
| XGBoost              | 0.937     | 0.950     | 0.754    | 0.840    | 0.950    |


âœ… **Best Model:** XGBoost â€“ chosen for final predictions due to **highest accuracy (93.7%)** and **strong precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.

## ðŸ”§ Hyperparameter Tuning


Hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance. The XGBoost model with tuned parameters achieved an accuracy of 93.81%, precision of 96.45%, recall of 74.54%, F1-score of 84.09%, and ROC-AUC of 0.95, significantly outperforming the baseline models. This tuning improved the balance between precision and recall, leading to better overall classification results.
